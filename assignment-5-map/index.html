			Arabs don’t really golf. <br><br> But here we are, in Saudi, in the middle of a desert. A proper golf course, lush grass and all. Multi-million dollar project. Empty.

		<div class="card card-golf">
			We don't come here to golf though. We come here to hide. Late at night. Find a hole in the grass, sit down, and hang out.

			Let me show you some of my other frequented spots. Like: the ‘Dining Hall’.

			I'm walking with a tray of waffles on my plate. Around me, some suits. Some abayas. Some t-shirts. We find a corner so we can talk about last weekend. Hoping our parents are not there. Or their friends. Eyes are everywhere.

			Okay. I'm done eating. Let's drive to my house.

		<div class="card card-driving-one">
			The roads here are paved perfectly, palm trees spaced out evenly in the median. Bushes covering the desert.
		</div>	

		<div class="card card-driving-two">
			The roads are ingrained in my memory. Slow down for the security cameras. Watch the trap on King's Road. And speed everywhere in between.

			I'm blasting Kendrick in the car, but I turn down the volume when I pass the mosque near me house. The bass and athan seem incompatible.

			But I can't let you in. <br><br>I don't really like having people over. It's a bit awkward. Watching what I say, watching what you say. Making sure they don't know.

			Let's step outside. Let me explain where we are.

		<div class="card card-aramco-intro center">
			Saudi Aramco compound, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. <br><br>Population: 15,000, employees and families affiliated with the world's largest oil company. <br><br>Everyone living in the same confined corporate town. Upper middle class. Saudi mostly, but lots of foreigners too.

			My family moved here from Florida in 2003. Post 9/11, a safe haven from the US. People who talk like us, look like us, share the same values. A bubble with its rules and laws, not quite Western, not quite Saudi.

			A safe space - built on oil, the destruction of the environment, and migrant worker exploitation.

		<div class="card card-aramco center">
			In my childhood though, it felt like suburbia. We were living the American dream in Saudi. Two cars, a stable home. American education, American sports. It felt more Western in some ways than Florida, where I only ever interacted with other Muslims in our small community.
