			Arabs don’t really golf. <br><br> But here we are, in Saudi, in the middle of a desert. A proper golf course, lush grass and all. Multi-million dollar project. Empty. 
		<br><br>
		We don't come here to golf though. We come here to hide. Late at night. Find a hole in the grass, sit down. 
		</div>
		<div class="card card-dining">
			Let me show you some of my other frequented spots. Like: the ‘dining hall’. Names are literal here: Dining Hall, Snack Bar, Office. Corporate building 119, 120.

			I'm walking with a tray of waffles on my plate. Around me, some suits. Some abayas. Some t-shirts. We find a corner so we can talk about last weekend. Hoping our parents are not there. Or their friends. Eyes are everywhere.
		</div>
		<div class="card card-driving-intro">
			Let's drive to my house.
		</div>		

		<div class="card card-driving-one">
			The roads here are paved perfectly, palm trees spaced out evenly in the median. Bushes covering the desert. An illusion of foreign suburbia.
		</div>	

		<div class="card card-driving-two">
			The roads are ingrained in my memory. Slow down for the security cameras. Watch the trap on kings road. And speed everywhere in between.
		</div>	


		<div class="card card-mosque">
			I'm blasting Kendrick in the car, but I turn down the volume when I pass the mosque. The bass and athan seem incompatible.
		</div>		
		<div class="card card-house">
			Okay. I'm home. But I can't let you in there. I don't really like having people over. It's a bit awkward. Watching what I say, watching what you say. Making sure they don't know.
			<br><br>
			Let's step outside. Let me explain where we are.
		</div>		
		<div class="card card-aramco-intro">
			Saudi Aramco. Population: 15,000, employees and families affiliated with the world's largest oil company. <br><br>Everyone living in the same box. Upper middle class. Saudi mostly, but lots of foreigners too.
		</div>			
		
		<div class="card card-aramco">
			My family moved here from Florida in 2003. Post 9/11, a safe haven from the US. People who talk like us, look like us, share the same values. Boxed in a little bubble, with its rules and laws. 
			<br><br>
			A safe space - built on oil, the destruction of the environment, and migrant worker exploitation. 

		</div>			

		<div class="card card-aramco">
			In my childhood though, it felt like suburbia. We were living the American dream in Saudi. Two cars, a stable home. American education, American sports.
