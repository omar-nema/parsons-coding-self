 



var storyGolf = `<p>
Arabs don’t really golf. But here we are, in Saudi, middle of a desert. A proper golf course, lush grass and all. Multi-million dollar project. Empty. 
<br><br>
We don't come here to golf though. we come here to hide. late at night. Find a hole in the grass, sit down.

var storyDining = `
<p>
Let me show you some of my other frequented spots. Like: the ‘dining hall’. Names are literal here: Dining Hall, Snack Bar, Office. Corporate building 119, 120. 
<br><br>
I'm walking with a tray of waffles on my plate. Around me, some suits. Some abayas. Some t-shirts. We find a corner so we can talk about last weekend. Hoping our parents are not there. Or their friends. Eyes are everywhere.
</p>
`

var storyDriving = `
<p>
I get in my car and drive. The roads are paved perfectly, palm trees spaced out evenly in the median. Bushes covering the desert. An illusion of foreign suburbia.
<br><br>
The roads are ingrained in my memory. Slow down for the security cameras. Watch the trap on kings road. And speed everywhere in between.
</p>

var storyDrivingMosque = `
<p>
I'm blasting kendrick, but I turn down the volume when I pass the mosque. The bass and athan seem incompatible.
</p>

`

var storyHouse = `
<p>
Okay. I'm home. But I can't let you in there. I don't really like having people over. It's a bit awkward. Watching what I say, watching what you say. Making sure they don't know.
<br><br>
Let's step outside. Let me explain where we are.

var storyAramco1 = `
<p>
Saudi Aramco. Population: 15,000, employees and families affiliated with the world's largest oil company. Everyone living in the same box. Upper middle class. Saudi mostly, but lots of foreigners too.
<br><br>
My family moved here from florida in 2003. post 9/11, a safe haven from the US. people who talk like us, look like us, share the same values. Boxed in a little bubble, with its rules and laws.
<br><br>
A safe space - built on oil, the destruction of the environment, and migrant worker exploitation. 
<br><br>
In my childhood though, it felt like suburbia. We were living the American dream in saudi. two cars, a stable home. american curriculm. sports. the only difference is, well, that we were mostly arab, that we were in saudi arabia. why were we learning american history?
