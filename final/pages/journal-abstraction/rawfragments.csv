"yesterday at the barbershop. egyptian barber. talking 3araby. after, bringing cup of coffee. difficult for me to express nuanced thoughts. but understood him. story of his immigration. how he brought brother in illegally, but at cost of 12k. his views. arab are backwards, believing shit like if a woman uses a certain toilet she will have jin go inside her."
w siavash yesterday: talk about moneys and salary and opportunities. and then recruiter talk.
"finally grasping the parameters that shape my actions around fam. like: how i need to exercise. need to spend bits in the day of solo solo time. how praying 5x / day will get to me. when i'm resilient, when i'm not. but i did not do enough with this info. i"
"home is home partly b/c it's compartmentalization. it's mine. this world i've built for myself, away from family? that's dark / maybe not true."
"and then after, seeing maha in the park. and chatting. so peaceful. talking about. perfectionism. how asya struggles w that. and i'm kind of the opposite. more of a healthy outlook i suppose.

"D towards end of convo saying: 'these conversations are distracting us from the main goal of business success'. me: my main goal is my career success, not the business. harsh i suppose."
