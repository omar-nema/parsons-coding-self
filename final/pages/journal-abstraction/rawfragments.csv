"put the piercing in to feel different, take the piercing out to feel the same"
"what should I do so that I can acknowledge, live with, imperfection"
a pimple
self-awarness as my best creative asset
"ew @ at the phrase 'the travel bug', 'poison of choice'"
how do you stop thinking the bad thought
boredom coping strategy: think about my place in the world big big big
will I ever like how I look or am I just not my type
"ambient music as a baseline, mood stabilizer, etc"
stressing myself out
just analyze it stop doing it?
just nap when I need to nap okay
rolling one window down while rolling the other up
there is something here but don't name it
today I believe in routine
